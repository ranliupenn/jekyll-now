Welcome to my site! I currently live in Philadelphia, pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Sociology and a Dual Master's Degree in Statistics at the University of Pennsylvania. My current research interest include social stratification and inequality, education, gender, poverty, survey methods, quantitative methods, and East Asia. I am also interested in data mining, machine learning, and social network analysis. 

Before coming to the U.S., I lived in Hong Kong for seven years, where I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Sociology from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and helped to build nonprofit microfinance projects for poverty alleviation in rural China. I also stayed a semester at University of Miami and another one at the National Taiwan University as an exchange student, and I visited Japan for half a year for language training at the Japan Foundation Kansai Center. I speak English, Chinese Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and I am actively learning Spanish now! 

I am highly concerned with the underrepresentation of women in STEM areas, because it does not only contribute to the gender wage gap, but also exacerbates the problem of gender stereotypes. I am the founder of [Women in Kaggle Philly](https://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Kaggle-Philly/) and currently organizing a series of workshops which provide an inclusive and supportive environment to women who are interested in data science. 

I regularly write for Foreign Policy, Boston Review, and The CGCS Media Wire Blog. I am a senior editor and contributor to [CNPolitics.org](http://cnpolitics.org/), an independent group committed to introducing academic studies on Chinese society and politics to the general public in China. I also write for the [Initium Media Hong Kong](https://theinitium.com/) and HK01 as a journalist and columnist. Check it out if you read Chinese! 

Besides (a happy) academic life, I am a huge fan of baseball and sabermetrics - I learned SQL through analyzing MLB data! I am also a professional translator and a huge Science Fiction fan. I have translated seven books so far, including three academic books and four science fictions. My most recent translation project is Prof. Randall Collins' great work Violence: A Micro-sociology Theory.
